=============

A basic blog that connects to an API.

Here's the [live project demo.](https://odin-react-blog.vercel.app/)

### Disclaimer

This blog is powered by the first API I've ever built, as part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

It is intentionally left as-is to document my learning journey and contribute to the open-source community so other students can learn from the same project stages.

As directed by The Odin Project's guidelines:

> When making interactive projects like this one, you might be tempted to add more features, improve interactivity, user experience, design, and styling of your website, and so on.
> 
> We recommend not doing that and saving this effort for your portfolio projects. Focus mainly on meeting the project requirements.

### About

This project was completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [NodeJS](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/nodejs) curriculum. It is the sixth project required for completion of the NodeJS course.

These were the project requirements:

- [x] Develop a schema that handles posts, comments, and users.
- [x] Set up your routes and controllers following RESTful guidelines. 
- [x] Protect sensitive routes using authentication and tokens.
- [x] Once your API is working, you can focus on your front-end code. Technically, this is a back-end focused course, so if you prefer, feel free to focus on the REST API.

### What I Learned

In this project, I learned how to work with an ORM (Prisma), set up an authentication system with JSON Web Tokens, write requests and responses suitable for APIs, the basics of writing RESTful APIs, and how to make requests from a front-end system to an API properly.

### Notes

Building a beautiful, responsive website was not the goal here. I focused mostly on the API and front-end functionalities (such as fetching a user's details). I only added some very basic CSS to make things readable. :laughing:

This project is currently being hosted on the following platforms:

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) (front-end website)
- [Render](https://render.com/) (API)
- [Neon](https://neon.tech/) (database)

As of today (11/10/24), this website is fully operational. This project is live thanks to the help and support of the companies above, who provide excellent free-trial services.

Should this project become unresponsive or offline, itâ€™s most likely due to a change in the business plans of any of these providers. We all have bills to pay, so no judgment. ðŸ˜…
